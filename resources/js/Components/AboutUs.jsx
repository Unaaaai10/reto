  <h3  class="text-center">ABOUT US</h3>
        <p class="text-center">We are a passionate team of three young web developers with a shared vision: to make the planning of indoor and outdoor activities an easy and exciting experience for everyone. We, Borja, IÃ±aki and Unai, came together with the goal of creating an application that not only simplifies activity organization but also inspires people to explore new experiences and create lasting memories.</p>
        <p class="text-center">The idea for Hop Up was born out of our own need to find exciting and accessible ways to spend our leisure time. Faced with the task of planning activities, we realized that many available resources were either complicated or lacked the inspiration we were seeking. That's when we decided to join forces and develop a solution that not only addressed our own challenges but also benefited people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>
        <p class="text-center">At Hop Up, we strive to empower users to discover and enjoy a wide variety of activities, whether exploring new outdoor trails, participating in cultural events, or simply finding interesting indoor hobbies. We aim to remove the barriers that often hinder planning and foster a culture of adventure and fun </p>
